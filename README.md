# WordModPy
An aggregator of all the word-altering functions I've created. Takes in a string and asks which function to apply, then returns the modified string.

Functions:

Isogram: checks if a word is an isogram (a word only containing each letter once)

camelCase: converts any teststring to camelCase

Persistence: tests how many times you have to multiply the digits of a number by each other until you get a single digit number

ParenthesisEncode: encodes each character in a string to ")" if the character appears more than once, or "(" if it only appears once

CipherEncode: Encodes the string using the given map

PassStrengthTest: uses regex to test if a given password is strong (contains at least 1 upper/lowercase letter, 1 number, and is at least 8 characters long)
